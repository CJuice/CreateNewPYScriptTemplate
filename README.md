# CreateNewPYScriptTemplate
Input your info and create a new .py file with a proper header
This script is intended to be used at the start of a new project when you need a new .py file and want to have a well documented header without typing all of the "*", etc for formatting. The script prompts you for the details and then builds the header and stores the .py, with the name you choose, in the location you choose.
Inputs: root path where the new file will be created; name of the file; author name; purpose of the script; inputs; outputs;
Outputs: .py file
